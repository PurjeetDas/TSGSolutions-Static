    content : We are very pleased with the progress that we've made with TSG. They have demonstrated that they can train quickly by using our internal software and platforms with ease. By adding TSG as our dedicated remote team, we are now better able to assist our customers in real-time, which gives us a competitive edge. While working closely with their team, we have developed a great rapport. Their team takes quick action when needed and also takes the time to call out issues when they spot something that might be off. I appreciate this type of intuition and forward-thinking approach. We are lucky to be entering the holiday season with their assistance. We look forward to continuing working with TSG for the years to come.
